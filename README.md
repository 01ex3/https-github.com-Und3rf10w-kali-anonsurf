# kali-anonstealth

ParrotSec's anonsurf and stealth, ported to work with Kali Linux.

How to use this repo
=======

This repo contains the sources of both the anonsurf and pandora packages from ParrotSec combined into one.

Modifications have been made to prevent data leakage and use the DNS servers of Private Internet Access (this is simple to change).

This repo can be compiled into a deb package to correctly install it on a Kali system.


NOTE: This may work with any debian/ubuntu system, but this has only been tested to work on a Kali 2.0 amd64 system
